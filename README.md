A beautiful Android app that displays inspiring quotes transliterated into ancient runic scripts. Built with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 Design, featuring Elder Futhark, Younger Futhark, and Tolkien's Cirth (Angerthas) scripts.

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Daily Runic Quotes**: Get a new inspirational quote every day, transliterated into runes
- **Multiple Runic Scripts**: Support for three ancient writing systems:
  - **Elder Futhark**: The oldest runic alphabet (2nd-8th centuries)
  - **Younger Futhark**: Simplified Viking Age runes (9th-11th centuries)
  - **Cirth (Angerthas)**: Tolkien's elvish runes from Middle-earth
- **Live Transliteration**: Automatic conversion from Latin alphabet to runic scripts
- **Home Screen Widget**: Display quote of the day directly on your home screen

### Advanced Features
- **User-Created Quotes**: Add your own quotes with live runic preview
- **Favorites System**: Mark and filter your favorite quotes
- **Quote Management**: Browse, edit, and delete your custom quotes
- **Quote Sharing**: Export quotes as beautiful images or share as text
- **Expressive Animations**: Sequential character-by-character rune reveal effect
- **Material 3 Design**: Modern UI with dynamic theming support

### Technical Highlights
- **Offline-First**: All quotes stored locally with Room database
- **Clean Architecture**: MVVM pattern with proper separation of concerns
- **Reactive UI**: StateFlow-based reactive updates throughout the app
- **Type Safety**: 100% Kotlin with comprehensive unit tests
- **CI/CD Ready**: Automated testing and builds with GitHub Actions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or newer
- JDK 17 or higher
- Android SDK with API level 26+ (Android 8.0 Oreo)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/po4yka/runatal-android.git
   cd runatal-android
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Select "Open an Existing Project"
   - Navigate to the cloned repository
   - Wait for Gradle sync to complete

3. **Run the app**
   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator
   - Click the "Run" button (▶️) or press Shift+F10
   - Select your target device

### Building from Command Line

```bash
# Debug build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Release build (requires signing configuration)
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Run unit tests
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest

# Run static analysis
./gradlew detekt

# Run all checks
./gradlew check
```

The APK will be generated at:
- Debug: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- Release: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

## 🧪 Testing

The project maintains high test coverage with comprehensive test suites:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run tests with coverage report
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest jacocoTestReport

# Run specific test class
./gradlew test --tests "ElderFutharkTransliteratorTest"

# Run instrumented tests (requires emulator/device)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Transliterators: 260+ tests covering all three runic scripts
- Repository Layer: 30+ tests with MockK
- ViewModels: 65+ tests using Turbine for Flow testing
- Overall: ~90% coverage for critical business logic

## 📚 Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
app/
├── data/              # Data layer
│   ├── local/         # Room database, DAOs, entities
│   ├── preferences/   # DataStore preferences
│   └── repository/    # Repository implementations
├── domain/            # Domain layer
│   ├── model/         # Domain models (Quote, RunicScript)
│   └── transliterator/# Business logic for rune conversion
├── di/                # Dependency injection modules
└── ui/                # Presentation layer
    ├── components/    # Reusable UI components
    ├── screens/       # Screen composables & ViewModels
    ├── theme/         # Material 3 theming
    └── widget/        # Home screen widget
```

**Key Design Patterns:**
- **MVVM**: ViewModels manage UI state, Views observe StateFlows
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data sources from business logic
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt provides dependencies across layers
- **Single Source of Truth**: Room database as the primary data source
